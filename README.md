# AutoJail

## Description
This is a plugin made for Skeppy to use whilst hosting events

## What are the permissions?
The permissions are:
- `jailwand.get` - Allows the user to run /jailwand to get one of the wands
- `jailwand.use` - Allows the user to use the wand 
- `jailwand.revive` - Allows an admin to run /revive and bring a random player in jail back to the game

## How do I use it?
Once you have a wand and permission to use it, you can right click on a player to send them to 'jail'. Jail is defined as that world's spawn point.

If you wish to randomly bring back a player from jail, you can run /revive. This will randomly select a player that's in jail and teleport them to whoever ran the command
